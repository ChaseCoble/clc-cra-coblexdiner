This is a customizable application for a restaurant storefront. In order to customize, you only need edit the objects in catalogues. 
Runs on Node version 18.13.0.
The masterCatalogue has 7 tiers: the master object(masterCatalogue), menu(aboutUs, breakfast), submenu header(categoryName, subCategories), submenu (introduction, specials), submenu content headers (content, featuredImgSrc, content), content categories( price, desc, name), and the content itself. 
Of these tiers, the menu, submenu(except for introduction) and the content itself can be edited to your liking to support any structure of products. You can also connect a source path to the featuredImgSrc property to display an image alongside each image category.
At this time, the app will support a full length of tabs of one row. 
Chat bot dialogue may also be added through the selectChatbotDialogue into its proper context categories which are paired with the master catalogue. 

Future updates will include a GUI content manager and a wrap styling to allow an increasing amount of categories and sub categories to support any store front.
